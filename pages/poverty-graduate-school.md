summary: ways to avoid being excessively poor in graduate school
tags: [Academia]

Entering graduate school (a Ph.D. program specifically) means living a life of genteel poverty unless you have independent means. Lots of graduate students are (seemingly) not nearly as good at managing their expenses as they could be (myself included). Check out [gradpay](http://gradpay.org/results/table/) to see a good comparison of stipends in different fields/institutions.

Bear in mind that this is written by a guy from a relatively affluent family, which is not atypical for a graduate student. I have committed (sometimes grossly) all of the errors I caution against. These are just things I wish that I had done from day 1 of graduate school.

### Ways to Cut Costs

I started drinking coffee in graduate school, like many people. Buying coffee "out" gets expensive! A \$2 cup (which is relatively cheap) bought 5 days a week for the 10 month school year ends up being around \$400! Buy an [aeropress](http://www.aeropress.com/) instead!  An Aeropress with a steel filter is \$40, a good vaccum mug is around \$25 (such as this [REI](http://www.rei.com/product/794391/rei-vacuum-infuser-mug-15-fl-oz) one), an electric grinder is around \$20 (such as this [Krupps](http://www.amazon.com/KRUPS-F20342-Electric-Grinder-Stainless/dp/B00004SPEU/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1408292345&sr=1-1) one), and you can get good coffee for around \$5 a week (Trader Joe's woo!). In you first year the difference would be \$115. Over the course of the typical 5 year graduate program that would be \$575, which is not insubstantial (and this is a very conservative estimate).

Cook all (or almost all) of your meals. Cooking is much cheaper (and healthier) than eating out (even if it is cheap food). I spend less than \$300 a month. Check out [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/2dtpor/how_much_do_you_spend_on_food_a_week/) on [/r/frugal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/2dtpor/how_much_do_you_spend_on_food_a_week/) for comparison. Just eating lunch out during the week, assuming lunch averages to around \$10, is an extra \$100 a month! There are lots of great free cookbooks and recipes out there such as "[Good and Cheap](http://www.leannebrown.ca/good-and-cheap-pdf)" and "[From Scratch](http://www.leannebrown.ca/from-scratch-pdf)." Graduate school shouldn't entail a strict ramen diet. 

Use the library! Graduate students often get extended checkout times, so it is possible to get books for class from the library, as well as books for research. Ask to borrow books from other graduate students and professors (they all know how poor you are!). Then search around on the internet for a pdf copy (some great stats/ML books are free online such as [ESL](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)). There is usually a good local library in college towns as well and most university libraries can request books from one another. As a last resort buy a used copy.

### Necessities on the Cheap

Online backup! I use [Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/) combined with Amazon's [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/). Dropbox <strike>doesn't have a great space/price ratio for long term storage (also their versioning is not great for this)</strike> is a bit more expensive (depending on the size of your data) and the versioning isn't quite as great as Arq, but it is really easy to use. Backups to external drives are seemingly never done very regularly, and so they aren't a great idea imo. Even if you get an expensive network enabled external drive you will only be backing up to it when you are on your own network. With an online backup you can do so with arbitrary frequency. The S3 and Glacier combination costs around \$2-3 a month. [Crashplan](http://www.code42.com/crashplan/) is a good alternative (but more expensive). Do max out your free Dropbox storage though: it is [pretty easy](https://www.dropbox.com/getspace).

A Macbook. Unless you *must* have some proprietary software that is specific to Windows, you should be buying a Macbook. The price disaprity between other laptops of (arguably) comparable build quality and hardware specs is not nearly as big as it is made out to be. If you dislike Apple for philosophical reasons (which I sympathize with) it comes down to pragmatism. Various flavors of Linux are great, but unless you are *really* devoted (or super competent w/ \*nix) you will probably spend more time maintaining the environment than you do being productive in it. Much of the really great \*nix software is available on the Mac through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), which is an excellent package manager. Check out [my post](/mac-setup/) on setting up a Mac for statistical computing if you go this route.

### Ways to Make Money

Investing! This does *not* mean trading stocks (i.e. gambling). There are services such as [Wisebanyan](https://wisebanyan.com/) which do [portfolio optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization) with indices, bonds, etc., based on your risk disposition (based on a short survey). Even if you can save a few hundred (or less) a month this can be huge over the course of your graduate career. [Compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) is great! If you can save \$200 a month for all 5 years, and we assume a fixed annual growth rate of 10%, and a monthly compunding period, this would return \$15816 from a principal of \$6000. You don't have to wait to save until you have a "real" job. Time is money.

Use/invest in your technical skills. Consulting can make you a good second income: programming and statistics/math skills especially. Do be careful to not let it eat into research time if you want academia to remain a viable goal though!

Since I am (sort-of) in my second year of graduate school (actually my 5th year...) I am sure I will add to this. Let me know if there is anything you wish you had done that would have made during grad school that would have made you financially better off now!
