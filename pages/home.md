Hello! I am a second year Ph.D student in political science studying applied statistics at [Penn State](http://polisci.la.psu.edu/) (more [about me](/about/)). My [research](/cv/#research) focuses on statistical learning with dependent data, applications of these methods in comparative politics, and research practice in the social sciences generally. [Email me](mailto:zmj@zmjones.com) (`zmj@zmjones.com`) if you'd like to talk!
